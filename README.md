# Python-all-basic

<p>Python is interpreted and high level dynamic programming language which was originated in the year of late 1980s but it was implemented in December 1989 by Guido Van Rossum.</p>

<p>Mutable datatype : The value assigned to a variable can be changed. </p>

<p>Immutable datatype : The value assigned to a variable cannot be changed.</p>

<p>Integer : Integers are whole numbers, such as 1, 20, 3000, 10200305, etc. They are declared simply by writing a whole number. (Immutable)</p>

<p>String : String is sequence of Unicode characters. We can use single quotes or double quotes to represent strings. (Immutable)</p>

<p>List : list is an ordered sequence of items. we can use square brackets to represent list.</p>

<p>Tuple : Tuple is an ordered sequence of items same as a list. The only difference is that tuples are immutable.</p>

<p>Set : Set is an unordered collection of unique items. Set is defined by values separated by comma inside braces { }.</p>

<p>Dictionary : Dictionary is an unordered collection of elements. The elements in dictionaries are stored as key&ndash;value pairs.</p>

<p>For loop : The for loop in Python is used to iterate over a sequence (list, tuple, string) or other iterable objects.</p>

<p>While loop : The while loop in Python is used to iterate over a block of code as long as the test condition is true.</p>

<p>do_while loop : The do while loop is used to check condition after executing the statement. It's like while loop but it is executed at least once.</p>

<p>Break : The break statement terminates the loop containing it. Control of the program flows to the statement immediately after the body of the loop.</p>

<p>Continue : The continue statement is used to skip the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration only. Loop does not terminate but continues on with the next iteration.</p>

<p>Function : Function is a block of code that performs a specific task. It has a name and it is reusable.</p>

<p>Variable Scope : The scope of the variable reffers to which part of the code, the variable can be referenced, or used.</p>

<p>Operator : operators are special symbols that carry out arithmatic or logical computation. The value that the operator operates on is called operands.</p>
